# Case Study: Telemetry Data Engineering with Bauplan

> A production-ready demo showcasing modern data engineering practices using Bauplan's Write-Audit-Publish (WAP) pattern for telemetry data processing at Intella.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build **robust, scalable ETL pipelines** using [Bauplan](https://www.bauplanlabs.com/), a modern data engineering framework. It implements a realistic telemetry data processing scenario for Intella, showcasing best practices in data quality, type safety, and pipeline orchestration.

### What is Bauplan?

Bauplan is a next-generation data engineering platform that enables:
- **Declarative pipeline definitions** - Define data transformations as code
- **Built-in data quality** - Native support for the WAP pattern
- **Type-safe transformations** - Full Python type checking integration
- **Reproducible builds** - Immutable data lineage and versioning

### The Write-Audit-Publish (WAP) Pattern

The WAP pattern ensures data quality through three distinct phases:

1. **Write** - Data is written to a staging area without affecting production
2. **Audit** - Data quality checks validate completeness, accuracy, and consistency
3. **Publish** - Only validated data is atomically promoted to production

This pattern provides:
- ✅ Zero downtime deployments
- ✅ Rollback capabilities
- ✅ Data quality guarantees
- ✅ Clear audit trails

## Features

### Data Engineering
- 🔄 **ETL Pipelines** - Extract, Transform, Load workflows for telemetry data
- 📊 **WAP Pattern Implementation** - Production-grade data quality assurance
- 🔍 **Data Validation** - Comprehensive quality checks at every stage

### Code Quality
- 🎯 **Type Safety** - Full type annotations with ty type checker
- ⚡ **Fast Linting** - Ruff for lightning-fast code quality checks
- 🔒 **Pre-commit Hooks** - Automated quality gates before every commit
- ✅ **High Test Coverage** - Comprehensive pytest suite with branch coverage

### Modern Tooling
- 🚀 **uv Package Manager** - Fast, reliable dependency management
- 🛠️ **just Command Runner** - Simple, consistent development commands
- 📦 **Reproducible Environments** - Lock files and environment isolation

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.12+** - [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **uv** - Fast Python package manager
  ```bash
  # macOS/Linux
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

  # Windows
  powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
  ```
- **just** - Command runner ([installation guide](https://github.com/casey/just#installation))
  ```bash
  # macOS
  brew install just

  # Other platforms: see https://github.com/casey/just#installation
  ```

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/case-study-telemetry.git
cd case-study-telemetry

# Install dependencies and set up development environment
just install
```

This will:
- Install all dependencies via `uv`
- Set up pre-commit hooks
- Configure the development environment

### 2. Verify Installation

```bash
# Run all quality checks
just check
```

This runs:
- Ruff linting and formatting (with auto-fix)
- ty type checking
- pytest test suite with coverage

### 3. Development Workflow

#### Daily Commands

```bash
just lint     # Run linters (auto-fixes issues)
just test     # Run tests with coverage
just check    # Run all checks (lint + test)
```

#### Testing

```bash
just test                  # Run all tests
just test-verbose          # Verbose test output
just test-cov              # Generate HTML coverage report (opens htmlcov/index.html)
```

#### Running Specific Tests

```bash
# Run a specific test file
uv run --env-file .env -- pytest tests/test_version.py

# Run tests matching a pattern
uv run --env-file .env -- pytest -k test_telemetry

# Run with verbose output
uv run --env-file .env -- pytest -v
```

#### Maintenance

```bash
just clean          # Remove generated files (.pytest_cache, .ty_cache, etc.)
just pre-commit     # Run pre-commit hooks manually
just update-hooks   # Update pre-commit hook versions
```

### 4. Running the WAP Pipeline

The telemetry data pipeline can be run in multiple ways depending on your workflow needs.

#### Option 1: Using Prefect (Orchestrated Workflow)

Run the pipeline with full orchestration, monitoring, and scheduling capabilities:

```bash
# 1. Start all services (PostgreSQL, Prefect Server, Prefect Worker)
just launch

# 2. Deploy the WAP flow to Prefect
just deploy-flow

# 3. Open the Prefect dashboard to monitor and trigger runs
open http://localhost:4200
```

The Prefect dashboard (http://localhost:4200) provides:
- **Flow runs monitoring** - Track execution status and logs
- **Manual triggers** - Run the pipeline on-demand
- **Scheduling** - Set up automated runs
- **Execution history** - Review past runs and debug failures

To view logs:
```bash
just logs              # View all service logs
just logs-service prefect-worker  # View only worker logs
```

To stop services:
```bash
just stop              # Stop all Docker Compose services
```

#### Option 2: Local Python Execution

Run the pipeline directly without Prefect orchestration (useful for quick testing):

```bash
# Using just command
just run-flow

# Or directly with uv
uv run --env-file .env -- python -m case_study_telemetry.flows.wap_telemetry_flow
```

This runs the complete WAP pipeline:
1. **Write** - Creates staging branch, ingests data, runs transformations
2. **Audit** - Executes data quality checks
3. **Publish** - Merges to main (if configured) or shows diff

#### Option 3: VSCode Debugging

Debug the pipeline with breakpoints and step-through execution:

1. Open VSCode in the project directory
2. Press `F5` or go to Run → Start Debugging
3. Select **"Python: WAP Telemetry Flow"** from the debug configuration dropdown
4. Set breakpoints in the code as needed
5. The debugger will stop at breakpoints, allowing you to:
   - Inspect variables
   - Step through execution
   - Evaluate expressions
   - Review call stacks

The debug configuration automatically:
- Loads environment variables from `.env`
- Sets `VERBOSITY=DEBUG` for detailed logging
- Configures proper `PYTHONPATH`

#### Configuration

Before running the pipeline, ensure your `.env` file is configured:

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your settings
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

Key configuration variables:
- `S3_SOURCE_BUCKET` - Source S3 bucket for telemetry data
- `S3_SOURCE_PATH` - Path within the bucket
- `BAUPLAN_NAMESPACE` - Target namespace for tables
- `WAP_ON_SUCCESS` - Behavior after successful audit (`inspect` or `merge`)
- `WAP_ON_FAILURE` - Behavior after failed audit (`keep` or `delete`)

This project implements a realistic telemetry data processing pipeline for Intella, demonstrating:

### Data Pipeline Stages

1. **Extract** - Ingest telemetry data from various sources
   - IoT devices, sensors, application logs
   - Multiple data formats (JSON, Parquet, CSV)

2. **Transform** - Process and enrich data
   - Data normalization and type conversion
   - Aggregations and feature engineering
   - Time-series calculations

3. **Load** - Store processed data
   - Write to staging area (WAP: Write phase)
